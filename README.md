# HCMUS-News Scraper: a web scraper that crawl news from my university websites
## Inspired from this [github repo](https://github.com/huytrinhm/hcmus-news-crawler)
## Visit the [Results page](https://linhnph05.github.io/HCMUS-Scraper/announcements)

## Websites list that I scraping from:
* https://www.ctda.hcmus.edu.vn/
* https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/vn/
* https://hcmus.edu.vn/

## Technology: 
At first, I use Scrapy but then one of the page that I want to crawl has dynamic JS loaded content so I switch to Selenium.

## What I have learned: 
working with json, scraping static and dynamic content, how to overcome website's blocking objection.
